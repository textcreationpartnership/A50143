            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE ENGLISH, Who Ruine the INDIANS, by Selling Strong Drink unto them.</head>
            <p>HOW unaccountably, O Unadviſed neighbours, And how much to <hi>our</hi> Sorrow, and <hi>our</hi> Horror, is that Obſervation of the Sacred Scripture verified, <hi>The Love of Money is the Root of all Evil:</hi> When to get ſo <hi>Little Money</hi> as is to be got by it, ſo <hi>Much Evil</hi> is committed, as we hear &amp; ſee that ſome of <hi>you</hi> commit upon the Miſerable INDIANS!</p>
            <p>'Tis well known that the <hi>Indians</hi> which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Land, now to better purpoſe poſſeſſed and occupied by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the room of the Twenty Nations of the <hi>Indians</hi> that once covered it, were utterly deſtitute of all <hi>Intoxicating Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,</hi> before the Arrival of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hither. The Soveraign God, who hath provided for our Support in our Frailty, Liquid Cordials and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments of <hi>all ſorts,</hi> beſides, <hi>Wines on the Lees well refined,</hi> furniſhed <hi>Them</hi> with nothing but Water out of the <hi>Brook,</hi> and this to be handed unto their mouths, not in Glaſſes, but in Clam Shells, But, as <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> is moſt rare, in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109646:3"/>
that moſt abound with a variety of the Richeſt <hi>Wines,</hi> wherewith men are eaſily <hi>Drunk,</hi> ſo, on the other ſide, there are none that Rave more after <hi>Strong Drink,</hi> than the people of thoſe Countreys that have it from far brought unto them; and perhaps the Ravingeſt after it, of any Wretches under the cope of Heaven, are our <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Salvages.</hi> They will <hi>Sell</hi> and <hi>Pawn</hi> all they have in the world for <hi>Strong Drink;</hi> they never can tell when they have enough, but keep guzling until they have <hi>Drunk</hi> themſelves down; and when they <hi>Awake</hi> whatever it have coſt them, they ſay, <hi>I will ſeek it yet again.</hi> That which now gives inexpreſſible pain to all <hi>Good Men</hi> among us, is, That there are ſome <hi>Ill Men</hi> among the <hi>English</hi> in all corners of the Land, who to obtain a little bit of <hi>Money,</hi> do fit this vicious, drunken, ſottiſh Humour of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and Sell them the <hi>Drink,</hi> by which they cannot but think the Salvages will make themſelves <hi>Drunk;</hi> and ſometimes they take Advantage of the Humour which the Salvages are in, to <hi>Scrue</hi> them into Bargains full of cruel <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Extortion,</hi> which afterwards throw them into the extreameſt <hi>Inconveniencies.</hi> I dare not Relate, how many Tuns of <hi>Strong Drink,</hi> I am credibly informed, have been brought and ſpent among the <hi>Indians,</hi> within a few months even in <hi>One Little Iſland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems none of the wholeſome <hi>Laws,</hi> Enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſeveral <hi>Provinces</hi> &amp; <hi>Colonies</hi> againſt this

Who can think of this Impiety, without falling down in ſome Anguiſh before the Lord, and crying out, <hi>Oh! This people have Sinned a great Sin</hi>! But it is poſſible, that when the Sinful People, who <hi>Conſider not what they</hi> do, in this <hi>Great Sin,</hi> have ſome <hi>Conſiderations</hi> livelily Laid before them, the Good Spirit of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying thereof, may cauſe them to ſay, <hi>I have done Iniquity, I will do no more</hi>! and may keep others from falling into the like <hi>Iniquity.</hi> Now, Syrs, Let theſe Expoſtulations find ſome Entertainment with you: <hi>Oh, Hearken to me, that God may Hearken to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the Endeavour of every <hi>Godly man,</hi> and it is a Quality inſeparable from real <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> To do what may be done, for the <hi>Hindring</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> in other men: And then to <hi>Lament</hi> and <hi>Bewayl</hi> the <hi>Sin</hi> that can't be <hi>Hindred.</hi> The man who does not Labour to <hi>Suppreſs</hi> and <hi>Prevent Sin</hi> in thoſe that are about him, and who does not <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayl</hi> the <hi>Sin</hi> that he can't <hi>prevent,</hi> is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an Unconverted and an Unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Man, and an Enemy of God. I pray then, what will you judge of your ſelves, O ye Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the <hi>Indian Drunkenneſs?</hi> The <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> whereby thoſe forlorn Creatures do ſtumble into ſuch <hi>horrible Pits</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> ſo far is it from its being

It is plain, That if you dare go on in this Impiety, you are yet in the <hi>Gall of Bitterneſs, and the Bond of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi> &amp; if you Dy in this Unregenerate State, it had been <hi>Good for you, that you had never been Born.</hi>
            </p>

You muſt therefore know, That there is <hi>An having Fellowſhip with the Sins of other men, [Eph</hi> 5. 11.] And, [1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22] <hi>A being partaker of other mens Sins;</hi> by which <hi>you</hi> may contract an infinite Guilt unto <hi>your ſelves.</hi> When you ſupply the <hi>Indians,</hi> with the <hi>Drink,</hi> wherewith you are ſenſible, they will immediately <hi>Debauch themſelves, You</hi> have a criminal <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> with the <hi>Sins</hi> of their <hi>Drunkenneſs, you</hi> are

               <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> is indeed a <hi>Complicated Sin.</hi> If one ſhould Enquire, which of the <hi>Ten Precepts</hi> in the Law of God, are violated by <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> we may ſay, <hi>All the Ten,</hi> as well as the <hi>Third.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it not only <hi>unfits</hi> men to <hi>keep</hi> all the <hi>Laws</hi> of God, but alſo <hi>Inclines</hi> men to <hi>Break</hi> them all. If the <hi>Indians</hi> Tranſgreſs <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> of God by being <hi>Drunk,</hi> Then <hi>You,</hi> O unhappy <hi>Drink ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> are alſo Tranſgreſſors of all thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> in the <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> whereto you have ſo <hi>directly</hi> contributed. And, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to do thus unto the <hi>Indians,</hi> is a Fault that has its peculiar <hi>Aggravations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſion</hi> obliges us, yea, and it has been our moſt <hi>Explicit Profeſſion</hi> in theſe our <hi>American</hi> Settlements, To <hi>Civilize</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianize</hi> the <hi>Salvages.</hi> And is this the <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> that you Teach them, Syrs? Even the <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:109646:5"/>
which they never Learn't or Saw, till you, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Taught it unto them? They were <hi>Salvages</hi> before; ſome few <hi>Rational</hi> men among them, do bitterly complain of it, that by the <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> got in among them, they are made yet more <hi>Salvages:</hi> A <hi>Drunken Indian,</hi> what is he but a very <hi>Centaur?</hi> I pray, What are <hi>you</hi> then that make them ſo? If our Lord Jeſus Chriſt could ſay, <hi>Wo to you, that make a man twofold more the Child of Hell,</hi> Think of it, Syrs; The <hi>Indians</hi> were the <hi>Children of Hell</hi> before; but by their <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> they are <hi>twofold more</hi> ſo; for we are expreſly told, <hi>Drunkards ſhall not Inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Now, what a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſymptom of your own Excluſion from that <hi>Kingdom</hi> do you procure unto your ſelves, and whoſe <hi>Children</hi> will you declare your ſelves at laſt, by the Aſſiſtance that you give unto the <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> of thoſe that are thereby confirmed in their having the <hi>Devil</hi> for their <hi>Father? Wo to you, that make Indians twofold more the Children of Hell! Satan</hi> had a <hi>Strong Hold</hi> of theſe doleful Tawnies before; but by the <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you by your <hi>Strong Drink</hi> ſupport them, there is no ſmall <hi>Strength</hi> added thereunto, he <hi>holds</hi> them in the faſter <hi>Chains of Darkneſs.</hi> Truly, Syrs, I will deal <hi>Freely</hi> with you, and you are a ſort of Offenders, with whom the <hi>Sharpeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes,</hi> can't be ſaid to deal <hi>Harſhly:</hi> no <hi>Freedome</hi> is to be counted <hi>Harſhneſs.</hi> One well ſays, <hi>To Complement Vice is next to Worſhipping of the Devil</hi>!
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109646:5"/>
This miſcarriage of yours muſt not be <hi>Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented;</hi> The beſt that can be ſaid of it, is, <hi>That you do no little Service for the Devil in what you do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are Numberleſs <hi>Miſchiefs,</hi> that unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably follow upon the <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> wherein the <hi>Indians,</hi> by <hi>your</hi> means confound themſelves; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all the <hi>Woes</hi> of <hi>Drunkenneſs.</hi> There is what is as bad as <hi>Rats bane</hi> in the <hi>Drink</hi> that you Sell unto them; There's <hi>Death in the pot</hi>! They are <hi>Spoilt</hi> for all Employment and Buſineſs; and they that <hi>would not</hi> work before, now <hi>cannot</hi> work: their <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> has made them <hi>Good for nothing.</hi> Their <hi>Health</hi> is Loſt; and they often periſh by other <hi>Diſasters</hi> in their <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> confuting the Lying Proverb, <hi>A Drunken man gets no harm.</hi> Eſpecially, when they are Drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Strong Drink,</hi> their <hi>Drink</hi> very frequently proves the occaſion of their <hi>Drowning</hi> in the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Yea, ſome of them have been Tragically <hi>Burnt to Death,</hi> going from the Tortures of one <hi>Fire</hi> to another. And more than all This; 'Tis an uſual thing for their <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> to put them upon <hi>Bloody Quarrels,</hi> and thoſe have ſometimes iſſued in <hi>Bloody Murders.</hi> There may be a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cry of <hi>Blood</hi> againſt you, beyond what you are aware, for the <hi>Drink</hi> that you have Sold. The paltry bit of <hi>Money</hi> that you have taken for a bottel of <hi>Rum,</hi> or a pot of <hi>Cyder,</hi> may be the <hi>price of Blood</hi>! Fearful to be ſpoken!

the <hi>Door</hi> to theſe <hi>Miſchiefs: You</hi> are <hi>Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> to them All. Can you think of it, without ſome Aſtoniſhment?</p>
            <p>But there is, what is yet more Aſtoniſhing. The <hi>Glorious Goſpel of God</hi> is made wofully <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful</hi> among the <hi>Indians,</hi> eſpecially by this Vice of <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> getting in ſo much among them. The <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which forbids <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> under the dreadfulleſt penalties imaginable, how can it be welcome unto a Generation of <hi>Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>! There have been, and yet are <hi>Churches</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our <hi>Indians;</hi> and, <hi>Peantamapaug,</hi> as they call themſelves, or, <hi>men profeſſing Religion;</hi> and if I miſtake not, there are at this Time, above <hi>Thirty Aſſemblies</hi> of <hi>Indians,</hi> (tho' ſmall ones) in one of our Provinces, that meet for the Worſhip of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But it is the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all Vertuous men, who behold it, and even of the <hi>Indians</hi> themſelves, That the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Work</hi> is in extream Danger of coming to <hi>nothing:</hi> The Good Order in their <hi>Churches</hi> is Languiſhing; The <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> it ſelf is like to be loſt among them: That <hi>Great Work,</hi> which has been the Glory of <hi>New England,</hi> and which already too much <hi>comes too Little,</hi> is like e're long utterly to Expire and Vaniſh; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Decayes</hi> that have already prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, are Deplorable. Yea, I tremble to write, what I have lately Read, That ſome <hi>Old men</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Indians,</hi> affirm, that when they were <hi>Heathens,</hi> many of them were not ſuch great

Villians, as they are ſince they were <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Now, You Sellers of <hi>Drink</hi> to theſe <hi>Indians</hi> are the cauſe of all this Wretchedneſs. 'Tis the concurrent ſenſe of all who have any knowledge of the <hi>Indian Affayrs,</hi> That except a ſtop can be given unto <hi>your</hi> Ungodly Trade of <hi>Selling Drink</hi> unto the <hi>Indians,</hi> a <hi>Flood</hi> of <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> is like to Swallow up all that is good among them. And thoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who are carrying unto the <hi>Indians,</hi> the Tidings of that <hi>Great Saviour,</hi> are Sighing, <hi>That they Labour in vain, and ſpend their strength for nought,</hi> becauſe let them do what they can, <hi>Strong Drink</hi> does <hi>undo</hi> it all again; and there are [But whoſe <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> are <hi>thoſe,</hi> think you?] <hi>thoſe</hi> that by <hi>Selling Drink</hi> unto theſe wild <hi>Creatures,</hi> do ſo deprave them, and ſtupify them, and bruitify them, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ſo much as to beſtow a little <hi>Cicuration</hi> upon them, and reduce them from any part of their Barbarous <hi>Wildneſi.</hi> Now, if the Bleſſed Apoſtle, when he ſaw a Sorcerer <hi>withſtand</hi> the paſſage and progreſs of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> could <hi>Set his Eyes on him,</hi> and ſay, [Act. 13. 10.] <hi>O full of all miſchief, thou Child of the Devil, thou Enemy of all Righteouſneſs, wilt thou not ceaſe to pervert the right wayes of the Lord?</hi> Certainly, the Servants of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, obſtructed by <hi>your means</hi> in their Service to Him, and the Succeſs of His Word, may ſay to ſuch a <hi>Drink-Seller,</hi> O <hi>thou doer of unknown miſchief, by bewitching the poor Indians againſt all Good by the Word of God; Why

doſt thou ſo much gratify the Devil, and ſhow thy Enmity to all Righteouſneſs, by making it impoſſible for the Indians to leave their old Indian Tracks, or to learn the right ways of the Lord?</hi> Even the <hi>French Miſſionaries</hi> cry, <hi>Shame,</hi> upon you, as <hi>Acoſta</hi> long ſince did alſo upon <hi>his own</hi> Country-men; and <hi>they</hi> who Teach <hi>Idolatry</hi> to the <hi>Indians,</hi> are Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized at it, that <hi>you</hi> Teach them <hi>Drunkenneſs: Both</hi> of them indeed are <hi>Damnable;</hi> but <hi>your part</hi> is far more inexcuſable than <hi>Theirs; They Think,</hi> that they <hi>Save</hi> the Souls of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> you <hi>know</hi> that you <hi>Damn</hi> them.</p>
            <p>Can you now without ſome conſternation Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the <hi>Scandal</hi> that you give?
